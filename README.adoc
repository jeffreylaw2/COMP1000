== Rubric

It's easy to make errors when programming.
The science of computer science is diagnosing, fixing, and preventing errors.

[cols="2a,2a,2a"]
|===
|*Problem*
|*Common Causes*
|*Solutions*

|*Syntax error*

The code won't compile
|. Misused keywords or operators
. Class name does not match file name
. Missing `;` at end of statements
. Mismatched curly braces `{}`
|. Study code carefully
. Study compiler errors
. Study quick fixes
. Type curly braces together `{}` and then insert code

|*Semantic error*

The code compiles, but does not behave as expected
|. Misconceptions about Java
. Flawed assumptions in your code
. No automated test suite
. Inadequate testing
|. Debug: Set breakpoints and step over
. Test assumptions
. Write automated tests for your code
. Use a code coverage tool to ensure tests exercise all code

|*Schematic error*

The code is difficult to read, test, or understand
|. No comments
. Messy indentation
. Cryptic identifiers
. All code is in `main`
. Methods longer than a screen
. Duplicate code
. Reinventing the wheel

|. Explain why in the comments
. Indent properly. In Eclipse: `Ctrl-A` `Ctrl-I`
. Name appropriately, avoid single letters
. Separate Input, Computation, and Output
. Split methods into smaller ones
. Don't repeat yourself
. Delegate to the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?overview-summary.html[Java API] or https://github.com/akullpp/awesome-java[third-party libraries]
. Follow a https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html[style guide] or use a style checker
