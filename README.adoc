=== Introduce yourself
Welcome! Let's get to know each other with an icebreaker. Answer these questions:

* What is your name?
* Why is Computer Science your major?
* Tell us something nobody else in the room knows about you.

=== Run starterupper

Starterupper sets up git and project hosting for this class;
it is safe to run even if you already have git and SSH keys set up on your machine.

Open Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Linux, Mac OS X) and paste in the command below.
Press `Shift-Insert` to paste in Git Bash.

----
curl https://gitlab.com/lawrancej/COMP1000/raw/master/main.sh | bash

Introduction to Java

== January 15

Implement Mad Libs! Read in nouns, verbs, etc., and at the end, print out a silly story.

Open up Terminal or Git Bash.

----
cd ~/COMP1000
git pull upstream master
----

Open Eclipse

. File -> Import...
. General -> Existing Projects into Workspace...
. Click Next
. Click Browse...
. Navigate to your home directory -> COMP1000 -> workspace
. Click Open. You should see at the very least a project called Submissions.
. Click Finish

=== How to get stuff from me

. Right click on Submissions -> Team -> Remote -> Fetch from...
. Select upstream and continue.

Finally:

. Right click on Subissions -> Team -> Merge
. Select upstream/master
. Click Merge

You should now see `AnotherClass.java`

=== Submission

In Eclipse,

. Right click: Submissions -> Team -> Commit...
. Enter `Lab 1 Done` for the commit message
. Make sure `Main.java` is selected.
. Click Commit and Push

Or (in Git Bash or Terminal):

----
git commit -am "Lab 1 Done"
git push origin master
----

Today, let's shorten the code we developed in the lab using:

* `System.out.format` (namely, using `"%s"` as a placeholder and `\n` for newlines)
* Methods to allow us to define our own abstractions we can invoke and reuse.

By the way, these cause errors:

* The class name and file name (without `.java`) should match
* Mismatched curly-braces, or code outside of curly-braces (`{}`) won't work
