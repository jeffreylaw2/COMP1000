=== Introduce yourself
Welcome! Let's get to know each other with an icebreaker. Answer these questions:

* What is your name?
* Why is Computer Science your major?
* Tell us something nobody else in the room knows about you.

=== Run starterupper

Starterupper sets up git and project hosting for this class;
it is safe to run even if you already have git and SSH keys set up on your machine.

Open Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Linux, Mac OS X) and paste in the command below.
Press `Shift-Insert` to paste in Git Bash.

----
curl https://gitlab.com/lawrancej/COMP1000/raw/master/main.sh | bash

How to create your first program.

. Open Eclipse
. File -> New -> Project...
. Java -> Java Project...
. Enter Project name, Finish, and Open Java Perspective
. File -> New -> Class
. Enter Main for class name, and click Finish

Copy/paste this into `Main.java`:

----
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, world!");
  }
}

Introduction to Java basics

* `main`
* Types `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, `String`
* Variables
* Comments `// the compiler ignores this`
* Output using `System.out.println()`

It's easy to make errors when programming.
The science of computer science is diagnosing, fixing, and preventing errors.

[cols="2a,2a,2a"]
|===
|*Problem*
|*Common Causes*
|*Solutions*

|*Syntax error*

The code won't compile
|. Misused keywords or operators
. Class name does not match file name
. Missing `;` at end of statements
. Mismatched curly braces `{}`
|. Study code carefully
. Study compiler errors
. Study quick fixes
. Type curly braces together `{}` and then insert code

|*Semantic error*

The code compiles, but does not behave as expected
|. Misconceptions about Java
. Flawed assumptions in your code
. No automated test suite
. Inadequate testing
|. Debug: Set breakpoints and step over
. Test assumptions
. Write automated tests for your code
. Use a code coverage tool to ensure tests exercise all code

|*Schematic error*

The code is difficult to read, test, or understand
|. No comments
. Messy indentation
. Cryptic identifiers
. All code is in `main`
. Methods longer than a screen
. Duplicate code
. Reinventing the wheel

|. Explain why in the comments
. Indent properly. In Eclipse: `Ctrl-A` `Ctrl-I`
. Name appropriately, avoid single letters
. Separate Input, Computation, and Output
. Split methods into smaller ones
. Don't repeat yourself
. Delegate to the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?overview-summary.html[Java API] or https://github.com/akullpp/awesome-java[third-party libraries]
. Follow a https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html[style guide] or use a style checker

Implement Mad Libs! Read in nouns, verbs, etc., and at the end, print out a silly story.

Open up Terminal or Git Bash.

----
cd ~/COMP1000
git pull upstream master
----

Open Eclipse

. File -> Import...
. General -> Existing Projects into Workspace...
. Click Next
. Click Browse...
. Navigate to your home directory -> COMP1000 -> workspace
. Click Open. You should see at the very least a project called Submissions.
. Click Finish

=== How to get stuff from me

. Right click on Submissions -> Team -> Remote -> Fetch from...
. Select upstream and continue.

Finally:

. Right click on Subissions -> Team -> Merge
. Select upstream/master
. Click Merge

You should now see `AnotherClass.java`

=== Submission

In Eclipse,

. Right click: Submissions -> Team -> Commit...
. Enter `Lab 1 Done` for the commit message
. Make sure `Main.java` is selected.
. Click Commit and Push

Or (in Git Bash or Terminal):

----
git commit -am "Lab 1 Done"
git push origin master
----

Today, let's shorten the code we developed in the lab using:

* `System.out.format` (namely, using `"%s"` as a placeholder and `\n` for newlines)
* Methods to allow us to define our own abstractions we can invoke and reuse.

By the way, these cause errors:

* The class name and file name (without `.java`) should match
* Mismatched curly-braces, or code outside of curly-braces (`{}`) won't work

I have an `incoming` folder under Submissions.
Look, but don't touch (for now), unless you want a merge conflict.
*Hint:* you don't want merge conflicts.

Packages allow us to organize code into groups of related things.


Arrays/Loops

== January 22 Lab 2

Convert among units of temperature, mass, time, and distance:

Temperature:: Kelvin (K), Celsius (C), Fahrenheit (F)
Mass:: Kilograms (kg), Pounds (lbs), Grams (g), Ounces (oz)
Distance:: Meters (m), Kilometers (km), Miles (miles)
Time:: Seconds (s), Minutes (min), Hours (hr), Days (d), Years (y)

Example:

----
Unit converter.
Enter a measurement, unit, and new unit.
1500 g kg
1500 g = 1.5 kg
----

*Hint:* Pick a canonical unit for each unit (e.g., kelvin, grams, meters, seconds).
First convert from the starting unit to the canonical unit,
then convert from the canonical unit to the new (desired) unit.
This requires less work than converting directly between all possible pairs of units.

Feel free to:

* Add additional measures (e.g., inches, feet, centimeters)
* Keep prompting for units until the user enters quit
* Say `Invalid conversion` when asked to convert between incompatible units (e.g., inches to Fahrenheit)
