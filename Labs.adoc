== Lab 1: Mad Libs!

Implement Mad Libs! Read in nouns, verbs, etc., and at the end, print out a silly story.

== Lab 2: Unit conversion

Convert among units of temperature, mass, time, and distance:

Temperature:: Kelvin (K), Celsius (C), Fahrenheit (F)
Mass:: Kilograms (kg), Pounds (lbs), Grams (g), Ounces (oz)
Distance:: Meters (m), Kilometers (km), Miles (miles)
Time:: Seconds (s), Minutes (min), Hours (hr), Days (d), Years (y)

Example:

----
Unit converter.
Enter a measurement, unit, and new unit.
1500 g kg
1500 g = 1.5 kg
----

*Hint:* Pick a canonical unit for each unit (e.g., kelvin, grams, meters, seconds).
First convert from the starting unit to the canonical unit,
then convert from the canonical unit to the new (desired) unit.
This requires less work than converting directly between all possible pairs of units.

Feel free to:

* Add additional measures (e.g., inches, feet, centimeters)
* Keep prompting for units until the user enters quit
* Say `Invalid conversion` when asked to convert between incompatible units (e.g., inches to Fahrenheit)

== Lab 3: Letter count / anagram checker

Flesh out the starter code in the `Submissions/src/lab3` folder.

TIP: https://gitlab.com/lawrancej/COMP1000/blob/master/Git.adoc[How to submit work, confirm submissions, and receive updates]

Complete: `min`, `max`, `sum`, `average`

`int[] letterHistogram(String text)`:: Given a string, count the number of instances of each letter (`a`-`z` only) in an array.
Use the ASCII code of each character as the index in an array.
For example, in the string `hello world`, characters `w`, `h`, `e`, `r`, `d` each occur once, `o` occurs twice, and `l` occurs 3 times.

`boolean isAnagram(String thing1, String thing2)`:: Using `letterHistogram`, determine if two Strings are http://wordsmith.org/anagram/[anagrams of each other]. Examples:
 `dormitory` is an anagram of `dirty room`; `mars` is an anagram of `rams`).

== Lab 4: Interest and Guessing game

== Lab 5: Group project setup

=== Speed dating

Goal: find a partner or partners.

Ideally, work in pairs.
Working on this individually is *very* challenging and not recommended.
Groups of 3 are okay, but larger groups are not recommended.

=== Repository setup

Goal: Set up your repository for the group project.

----
curl https://gitlab.com/lawrancej/COMP1000Project/raw/master/main.sh | bash
----

. Add each of your friend(s) as collaborators to your Gitlab repository.
. Add your friend(s) SSH urls to git.

----
cd ~/COMP1000Project
./main.sh
